# Machine Learning-Based Optimization of Physical Layer Quantization for Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

Data used for this project could be accessed from 
Early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy helps slow down the progression to vision impairment. Such demand could be effectively satisfied by machine learningbased medical image recognition and classification. Physical layer optimization is important for the overall CNN performance. In this final project, we reported a CNN model with a quantization-optimized physical layer that enables DR severity classification tasks with high accuracy.
